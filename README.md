# Advent of Code 2019

So, this year (again) I decided to participate in https://adventofcode.com/. Because I was looking to learn some backend language, I decided for Elixir (I really like functional languages ðŸ’Ž). This repo has MY solutions to the Advent of Code 2019 challenge.

Remember, I'm looking to learn a new language, so you won't find any good practices, tests, or even good performance (maybe later I'll revisit this points). If you're looking for a Elixir solution of AoC19, here you go! The repo is divided in folders (days) with one to two .exs files with the solutions.
